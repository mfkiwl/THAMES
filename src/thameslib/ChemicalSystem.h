/**
@file ChemicalSystem.h
@brief Declaration of the ChemicalSystem base class.

A const `ChemicalSystem` object contains the data
relevant to the properties of every phase known to THAMES,
such as composition, growth characteristics, molar volume, specific
gravity, heat capacity, etc.
This class divides matter into three major types:
   -# <b>Independent Components</b> (ICs), which are basically chemical
elements.
   -# <b>Dependent Components</b> (DCs), which are composed of one or more ICs.
       DCs include ion complexes, pure condensed phases, and pure vapors.
   -# <b>Phases</b>, which are composed of one or more DCs.

The operation of THAMES depends heavily upon the design of the
`ChemicalSystem` class because the phase in each cell governs
the types of chemical reactions that can occur.  Therefore, careful attention
must be paid to making this class as useful and, at the same time, easy to use
as possible.

@struct PhaseData
@brief Stores data about each phase possible in the system for ease of parsing
the input files.

In THAMES, phases are identified either thermodynamically--- in the
GEM data repository--- or microstructurally.  A microstructural phase can
be one, or a combination of more than on, thermodynamically defined phase.

The structure is defined to make it easier to parse the input file for the GEM
chemical system definitions (CSD). It is not used elsewhere in the code.  In
fact, the same members are identified as class variables in the `ChemicalSystem`
class.

Most of the members have self-evident meanings:
    - `id` is the unique integer id of the microstructure phase
    - `randomGrowth` determines how much randomness is associated with the
       growth of the phase, rather than being determined only by mean curvature
    - `stressCalc` determines whether or not crystallization pressure should be
calculated
    - `weak` determines whether or not the phase can be damaged by stress
    - `k2o`, `na2o`, `mgo`, and `so3` are the mass fractions of potassium,
       sodium, magnesium, and sulfur oxides dissolved within the phase.
    - 'RdId' is a vector of all the ICs that can be incorporated into
         growing phases
    - 'RdVal' is a vector of maximum mass fractions of ICs that can be
incorporated into growing phases
    - `porosity` is the volume fraction of internal porosity in the phase,
       (e.g., C-S-H)
    - `red`, `green`, and `blue` are the rgb values for the color that the
       phase will have in simulated color micrographs
    - `gray` is the grayscale index the phase will have in simulated
backscattered electron micrographs
    - `thamesName` is the name the phase will have in the microstructure
    - `GEMPhaseName` is a vector of the GEM (thermodynamic) phases making up the
       THAMES phase, given by name
    - `DCName` is a vector of the GEM DCs (dependent components) making up the
       THAMES phase, given by name
    - `GEMPhaseDCMembers` is a vector of the GEM (thermodynamic) phase DC
       structures making up the THAMES phase, indexed by their GEM DC id number
    - `GEMPhaseId` is a vector of the GEM (thermodynamic) phases making up
       the THAMES phase, given by their GEM phase id number
    - `DCId` is the id of the dependent component in the GEM data base
    - `DCPorosity` is subvoxel porosity of the dependent components
    - `growthTemplate` is a vector of the growth templates for the phase
    - `affinity` the vector of affinities of a phase for another phase
    - `colors` is the rgb colors for displaying the phase in visualizations

/**
@class ChemicalSystem
@brief Handles the tracking of phases and communications between GEM and THAMES.

A `ChemicalSystem` object contains the data relevant to the properties of
every phase known to a given run of THAMES, such as composition, growth
characteristics, molar volume, specific gravity, heat capacity, etc.

@section intro_sec Materials
The class divides matter into three major types:
    -# <b>Independent Components</b> (ICs), which are basically chemical
        elements or a unit of charge
    -# <b>Dependent Components</b> (DCs), which are composed of one or
        more ICs.  DCs include ion complexes, pure condensed phases, and
        pure vapors
    -# <b>Phases</b>, which are composed of one or more DCs.

@section Phases
One of the biggest challenges with ChemicalSystem is that it is an interface
between the thermodynamic representation of phases, stored in the associated GEM
Chemical System Definition (CSD), and the phases as they are represented in the
3D microstructure. To accommodate this, ChemicalSystem keeps track of two
entirely different lists of phases, and keeps track of how the members of the
list are associated with each other. For example, the THAMES microstructure
includes a phase called CSHQ, which represents the calcium silicate hydrate
product (C-S-H).  However, the GEM CSD defines several different phases, which
are different compositional and structural end members of a non-ideal solid
solution that makes up C-S-H.  Therefore, THAMES must keep a list of all the GEM
phases that are collectively called CSHQ.  The same thing is true for certain of
the AFm and AFt phases.

@section methods Methods
THAMES communicates frequently with the GEM-IPM library, and so a lot of its
data and methods are devoted to storing and communicating GEM data, and
translating that GEM data into THAMES data that are used to create and change
microstructure.

  @brief Calculates new equilibrium state of the GEM system and relate to

  One of the main purposes of the [[ChemicalSystem]] class is to calculate
  changes to the state from one time increment to another.  This is accomplished
  by changing the chemical system definition to alter the quantitities
  of one or more independent components (IC), and then call GEM3K
  to calculate the new assemblage of DCs and phases that minimizes the
  Gibbs free energy subject to the IC quantities in the system.

  As a result, we need methods that will allow one to change the quantities
  of ICs and then to call GEM3K functions that will calculate the new
  state and return the values of the quantities of the DCs and phases.

  The method returns the GEM-IPM TNode status, which can be:

      - 0 = No GEM re-calculation needed for this node
      - 1 = Need GEM calculation with simplex (automatic) initial approximation
  (IA)

  /**
  @brief Calculate the site strain based on local crystallization pressure.

  The calculation of local crystallization pressure happens in this method,
  based on the saturation index of the phase.  Therefore, the method is
  currently restricted to problems of sulfate attack, and it probably can
  be generalized somewhat.

  Assuming that the saturation index \f$\beta\f$ is known for the phase,
  then the crystallization pressure should be the difference in the Laplace
  pressure between the large pore entrance, \f$r_{cp}\f$, and the size of the
  average gel pore, \f$r_{gp}\f$.  This pressure difference is

  \f[
      p_c = 2 \gamma \left[ \frac{1}{r_{gp} - \delta} - \frac{1}{r_{cp} -
  \delta} \right] \f]

  where we subtract \f$\delta\f$, the liquid film thickness, so that the terms
  in the denominator are the radii of curvature of the actual crystal in these
  two locations.

  In THAMES, we <i>assume</i> that the largest pore entrance to the gel porosity
  is about half the size of a lattice site.  The usual dimension of a lattice
  site in THAMES is 1 micrometer--- <b>although this is not necessary</b>--- so
  we assume that \f$r_{cp} = 500\f$ nm.

  The Thompson-Freundlich relation tells us the size of a crystal that is in
  equilibrium with a supersaturated solution with saturation index, relative to
  that crystal, of \f$\beta\f$.  The condition of equilibrium is that the
  chemical potential of formula units in the crystal be equal to the chemical
  potential of dissolved formula units in the solution:

  \f[
      V_c \gamma \kappa_{cr} = R T \ln \frac{Q}{K} = R T \ln \beta
  \f]

  where \f$V_c\f$ is the stress-free molar volume of the crystal, \f$\gamma\f$
  is the surface energy of the crystal-liquid interface, \f$\kappa_{cr}\f$ is
  the mean curvature of the crystal in equilibrium with the solution, <i>R</i>
  and <i>T</i> are the gas constant and absolute temperature, respectively, and
  <i>Q</i> and <i>K</i> are the activity product and equilibrium constant of the
  crystal dissociation reaction.  Therefore, the mean curvature is

  \f[
      \kappa_{cr} = \frac{R T}{V_c \gamma} \ln \beta
  \f]

  And since \f$\kappa_{cr} \equiv 2/r_{cr}\f$, we have \f$r_{cr} =
  2/\kappa_{cr}\f$ But \f$r_{gp}\f$ is the radius of curvature of the gel pore,
  not the crystal, so we must add the liquid film thickness: \f$r_{gp} = r_{cr}
  + \delta\f$.

  With the crystallization pressure, <i>p</i><sub>c</sub>, calculated, we must
  now estimate the local strain.  Ordinarily, this could be done only with
  detailed knowledge of the local pore structure.  However, to make the
  calculation tractable, we adopt the assumptions of poromechanics, in which
  case the strain is estimated by a volume-averaged equation,

  \f[
      \epsilon_x \approx \left( \frac{1}{3 K_p} - \frac{1}{3 K_s} \right)
      \left[ \phi p_c + pl - p_{atm} \right]
  \f]

  where \f$\epsilon_x\f$ is the linear strain (strain is assumed to be
  isotropic), <i>K</i><sub>p</sub> and <i>K</i><sub>s</sub> are the volume
  averaged bulk and shear moduli of the porous body, \f$\phi\f$ is the local
  porosity, <i>p</i><sub>l</sub> is the hydrostatic pressure in the liquid film,
  and <i>p</i><sub>atm</sub> is atmospheric pressure.

  @todo Consider renaming this function to calcCrystallizationStrain.

  @param SI is the saturation index of the growing crystal
  @param poreVolFrac is the local porosity
  @param Kp is the effective bulk modulus of the porous body
  @param Ks is the effective shear modulus of the porous body
