THAMES - SA version:
- transfer of the configuration (microstructure) from Controller to AppliedStrain/ThermalStrain is done using a lattice output file
- kmax_ is the number of relaxation steps for a given elastic computation: kmax_ = 3 for both AppliedStrain & ThermalStrain.

# Build and install THAMES with sulfate attack 

## Building on Unix or Linux

### Build GEMS3K libraries

1. go to PathToTHAMES/THAMES/src/GEMS3K-standalone/GEMS3K folder and modify the first two lines of the CmakeList.txt file from :

# Recursively collect all header files from the current directory
file(GLOB HEADER_FILES *.h)

# Recursively collect all source files from the current directory
file(GLOB SOURCE_FILES *.cpp)

to:

    # Recursively collect all header files from the current directory
file(GLOB HEADER_FILES *.h
  PathToTHAMES/THAMES/src/thames.h
  PathToTHAMES/THAMES/src/thameslib/*.h)

# Recursively collect all source files from the current directory
file(GLOB SOURCE_FILES *.cpp
  PathToTHAMES/THAMES/src/thames.cc
  PathToTHAMES/THAMES/src/thameslib/*.cc)

>>>>>

2. add to the node.h file header :
#include "PathToTHAMES/THAMES/src/thameslib/StrainEnergy.h"

>>>>>

3. modify the method Tnode::DC_G0 from the node.cpp file, changing the line:
G0 = CSD->G0[ jj + xTP ];
into:
G0 = CSD->G0[ jj + xTP ] + strainenergy[jj + xTP];

>>>>>

4. modify the method Tmulti::DC_LoadThermodynamicData from the ipm_simplex.cpp file, changing the line:
Go = dCH->G0[ jj+xTP];
into:
Go = dCH->G0[ jj+xTP] + strainenergy[jj+xTP];

>>>>>

5. go into “GEMS3K-standalone” folder:
`cd PathToTHAMES/THAMES/src/GEMS3K-standalone/`

>>>>>

	6. create a folder called “build”:
	`mkdir build`
	
	>>>>>
	
	7. move into “build” folder:
	`cd build`
	
	>>>>>
	
	8. run cmake command:
	`cmake ..`
	
	>>>>>
	
	9. run make command:
	`make`
	
	running make command will create a new folder called “lib” into “build” folder; this new folder must contains two files – our libraries (libGEMS3K.so & libGEMS3K-static.a)
	
	>>>>>
	
	10. check the two files creation:
	`ls lib`
	
	these two new files must be copied manually into a new folder called also “lib” that we will 	create into the “PathToTHAMES/THAMES/src/Resources” folder
	
	>>>>>
	
	11. create the new lib folder:
	`mkdir  PathToTHAMES/THAMES/src/Resources/lib`
	
	>>>>>
	
	12. copy the two libraries into this new create folder (we are into 	PathToTHAMES/THAMES/src/GEMS3K-standalone/build):
	`cp lib/* PathToTHAMES/THAMES/src/Resources/lib`

>>>>>

6'. alternatively to steps 6. to 12. run into "GEMS3K-standalone" directory the script called "install.sh", after modifying its content according to your OS (comment/uncomment “cmake” lines)
`./install.sh`

(on Linux needs administrator rights to finish its action)




### Build THAMES
Next, build and install THAMES. The recommended way to configure THAMES is to do an out-of-source
build, which means that the original files and directories are left untouched.
Doing this makes the re-compiling and cleaning of the installation files
much simpler.

1. cd /PathToTHAMES/THAMES/build
2. `cmake ..`
3. `make`
4. `make install`

This will install the "thames" executable in the “PathToTHAMES/bin” directory, and the
static libraries in the “PathToTHAMES/lib” directory.

#######

To use THAMES - SA version:
- for sulfate attack, all "iniAttack", "endAttack" and "frqAttack" time parameters must have positive and pertinent values (in days) :
 	"iniAttack" = 0,
	"endAttack"= 100,
	"frqAttack" = 2
or:
	"iniAttack" = 7, 
	"endAttack"= 150,
	"frqAttack" = 1

- for hydration, all "iniAttack", "endAttack" and "frqAttack" must equal “-1”:
	"iniAttack" = -1,
	"endAttack"= -1,
	"frqAttack" = -1
