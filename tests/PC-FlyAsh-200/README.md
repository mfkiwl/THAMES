## PC-FlyAsh-200

The input files in this directory will simulate the hydration of a w/c = 0.45 paste
of cement CCRL 140 at 298 K under saturated conditions with 20 % by mass
replacement of a Class F fly ash for the cement.

The system is 200 x 200 x 200 voxels, with each voxel being 1 micrometer in
dimension.

The user may edit the chemistry.json file to change the moisture conditions from saturated
to sealed.
