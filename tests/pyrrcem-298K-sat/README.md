## pyrrcem-298K-sat

The input files in this directory will simulate the hydration and redox
reactions for a portland cement paste with 10% by mass replacement with
pyrrhotite at 298 K under saturated conditions.

The system is 100 x 100 x 100 voxels, with each voxel being 1 micrometer in
dimension.

The user may edit the chemistry.json file to change the moisture conditions from saturated
to sealed.
